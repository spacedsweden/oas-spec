  description: >-
    A batch can be canceled at any point. If a batch is canceled while it's
    currently being delivered some messages currently being processed might
    still be delivered. The delivery report will indicate which messages were
    canceled and which weren't.


    Canceling a batch scheduled in the future will result in an empty delivery
    report while canceling an already sent batch would result in no change to
    the completed delivery report.
