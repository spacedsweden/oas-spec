  summary: Update a group
  description: >-
    With the update group operation you can add and remove members to an
    existing group as well as rename the group.


    The request will not be rejected for duplicate adds or unknown removes.


    The adds will be done before the deletes so if an MSISDN is in both lists
    then it will not be part of the resulting group.


    To remove an existing name set name explicitly to the JSON value null.
    Omitting name from the JSON body will leave the name unchanged.


    Updating a group targeted by a batch message scheduled in the future is
    allowed and changes will be reflected until the batch is sent.
